Hi there, thanks for watching my blog and reading my articles. A short note, I have decided to move my blog articles to a new platform on Hashnode.com. All of my articles have been relocated to this platform and will continue to be available at the following address: blog.walmsles.io. I am moving to hashnode for the community style benefits the platform provides which I do not h... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Correlating Transactions with Zero Code</title><link href="https://www.walmsles.io/posts/correlating-transactions-zero-code/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Correlating Transactions with Zero Code" /><published>2021-10-12T00:00:00+11:00</published> <updated>2021-10-13T00:03:34+11:00</updated> <id>https://www.walmsles.io/posts/correlating-transactions-zero-code/</id> <content src="https://www.walmsles.io/posts/correlating-transactions-zero-code/" /> <author> <name>Michael Walmsley</name> </author> <category term="serverless" /> <summary> I take pride in writing detailed, technical articles filled with solid code examples and links to Github so you can review and learn from my serverless journey. Today, I think this will be my shortest ever article, and it lacks all these things since starting on this Zero Code adventure. There are a lot of articles out there on correlating transactions across distributed systems and plen... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Serverless Integration, Zero Code</title><link href="https://www.walmsles.io/posts/serverless-integration-zero-code/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Serverless Integration, Zero Code" /><published>2021-10-09T00:00:00+11:00</published> <updated>2021-10-12T23:48:38+11:00</updated> <id>https://www.walmsles.io/posts/serverless-integration-zero-code/</id> <content src="https://www.walmsles.io/posts/serverless-integration-zero-code/" /> <author> <name>Michael Walmsley</name> </author> <category term="serverless" /> <summary> The words of Farah Campbell and Ben Kehoe on “The Serverless Mindset” has inspired me to level up my thinking and approach to Serverless integration. So let me share my journey to zero code integration with you. For my first foray into zero code integration, I decided to keep things simple and play with the classic integration pattern of sending data via an API into an SQS queue for dow... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Making All Your APIs Idempotent</title><link href="https://www.walmsles.io/posts/making-your-apis-idempotent/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Making All Your APIs Idempotent" /><published>2021-08-22T00:00:00+10:00</published> <updated>2021-08-22T00:00:00+10:00</updated> <id>https://www.walmsles.io/posts/making-your-apis-idempotent/</id> <content src="https://www.walmsles.io/posts/making-your-apis-idempotent/" /> <author> <name>Michael Walmsley</name> </author> <category term="serverless" /> <summary> When you start working with Serverless on AWS, one of the first questions you should be asking yourself is — “is my system Idempotent”? What is Idempotency? Idempotency is a straightforward but misunderstood concept. The dictionary defines Idempotency as “Unchanged when multiplied by itself”. In a micro-service context, this means any repeated action within the service will always have... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Getting Started with Serverless</title><link href="https://www.walmsles.io/posts/getting-started-with-serverless/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Getting Started with Serverless" /><published>2021-06-20T00:00:00+10:00</published> <updated>2021-06-20T23:56:44+10:00</updated> <id>https://www.walmsles.io/posts/getting-started-with-serverless/</id> <content src="https://www.walmsles.io/posts/getting-started-with-serverless/" /> <author> <name>Michael Walmsley</name> </author> <category term="serverless" /> <summary> I started learning about serverless development and AWS lambda in 2016 while working with startup companies building web APIs and single-page apps. These companies were Digital Agencies building out products to disrupt their industries and since they knew how to manage websites, server-based web hosting was the usual deployment environment. At this time I was heavily invested in docker containe... </summary> </entry> </feed>
