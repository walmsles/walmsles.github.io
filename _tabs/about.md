I am a Cloud Native Architect working with the [MyWizard Team](https://www.accenture.com/au-en/services/applied-intelligence/mywizard-intelligent-automation-platform){:target="_blank"} at Accenture to embrace Serverless Technologies.  This blog space contains articles based on my experiences in delivering Serverless Solutions at scale to production since 2018.

I learn new technologies quickly and have been deeply curious about AWS Lambda and Serverless solutions since they were initially released.  I designed and built the the Live score backend for the [Australia Open Web Site](https://ausopen.com){:target="_blank"} and hyper-performant serverless APIs for delivering live scores to millions of tennis fans around the world in 2019, 2020 and 2021.  Since delivering this project I have worked fulltime specialising in Serverless Enterprise Integration building out custom integration platforms between systems like ServiceNow, Salesforce and on premise data centre systems.

I am a passionate software engineer who likes nothing more than coding and guiding teams to build better Cloud Native Solutions.  A self professed Serverless Wizard with deep understanding on how to design and build solutions on the AWS Cloud.  Capable of coding in any language - NodeJS and Python are my current favourites.

I hope my blog articles are useful and informative, the opinions expressed in these pages are entirely my own.
